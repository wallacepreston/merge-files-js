# Merge Files

## What it Does

A JavaScript script that reads in two text files, creates a third file, merges the first two into the third, and lists the output (content of what went into the third file).

## To Run

Run the command:

`npm start`

This will take the two files `1.txt` and `2.txt` and create a third file, `3.txt`, printing the content of the third file to the terminal. This simply concatenates the two into the third file.

To run the simpler version, which only logs the contents of the two files together (doesn't create a third file), run the command:

`npm run start-simple`

## To Start Over

Run the command:

`npm restart`

This will delete the third file: `3.txt`
